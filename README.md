libevents
=========

Small callback library written in C++11.

The idea of this library is to provide something *like* an event system using C++11 lambdas. This can be used in scenarios like putting pieces together in the logic of a game. 

The library was designed to be small and also to provide a mechanism to serialize the events so they can be sent over the network.
